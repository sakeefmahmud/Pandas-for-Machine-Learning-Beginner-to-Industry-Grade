# **Pandas for Machine Learning – Beginner**

Welcome to **Pandas for Machine Learning**, a step-by-step guide designed to help new learners master the **Pandas library** using **real-world datasets**.
This repository walks you through **data manipulation, cleaning, feature engineering**, and **preparing datasets for machine learning models**, just like in real industry projects.

By the end of this tutorial series, you will be able to:

* Confidently work with **Pandas** for any ML workflow
* Clean and transform raw datasets into **ML-ready data**
* Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** like a data scientist
* Build a **complete preprocessing pipeline** for machine learning projects

## **🎯 Purpose**

The main goal of this repository is to **teach Pandas with a practical approach**:

* No boring theory — **everything is shown with real data**
* Easy-to-understand examples for beginners
* Step-by-step progression from **basic concepts** to **industry-level workflows**
* Covers **end-to-end preprocessing for machine learning**

Whether you are completely new to Pandas or want to prepare for **data science and ML projects**, this repo will guide you.

## **📝 Topics Covered**

This repository is divided into **modules**, each building on the previous one.

---

### **1. Introduction to Pandas**

Learn the core building blocks of Pandas:

* What is Pandas and why it’s important for ML
* Installing and importing Pandas
* Understanding **Series** (1D labeled data)
* Understanding **DataFrame** (2D table)
* Creating Series and DataFrames manually
* Loading data from CSV, Excel, or databases
* Saving data to different file formats

---

### **2. Basic Data Exploration**

Quickly understand your dataset:

* Viewing top/bottom rows with `head()` and `tail()`
* Checking dataset shape with `.shape`
* Summarizing data with `.info()` and `.describe()`
* Listing columns and index
* Identifying missing values and data types

---

### **3. Advanced Indexing and Filtering**

Master selection techniques:

* `loc` vs `iloc` vs `at` vs `iat`
* Filtering with conditions
* Boolean indexing (`&`, `|`, `~`)
* Using the `query()` method for clean filtering
* Slicing rows and columns efficiently
* Setting and resetting index

---

### **4. Real-World Data Cleaning**

Cleaning messy, real-world data like a pro:

* Handling **missing values**:

  * Dropping rows or columns
  * Filling with mean, median, mode
  * Forward and backward fill
* Handling **duplicates**
* Detecting and removing **outliers** using IQR/Z-score
* Correcting **data types**
* Making datasets consistent and ML-ready

---


### **5. Pandas in ML Workflow**

Learn how Pandas fits into a full ML pipeline:

* Separating features (`X`) and target (`y`)
* Scaling and standardizing data
* Preparing final ML-ready datasets
* Exporting data as `.pkl` files
* Loading clean datasets for modeling

---
